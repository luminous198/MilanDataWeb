                                    <p>Reading from the table above, we see there are no blank values when we consider the various costs associated. There is high variability in cost as indicated by relatively high standard deviation of 349.5. Other components have low variability and have low standard deviations. The median packing charge is 0 indicating 50% of the orders do not incur packing charges. Taxes range from 0-197.82, it would be interesting to see which items do not incur any taxes as most food items are taxed in India.</p>
                                    <p>For Further analysis, we have removed rows containing payment status other than 1. This leaves us with a total of 208 records in the order table. We will make use of Power BI for further analysis and visualizations.</p>

                                    <p>There does seem to be a large variation between delivery charges by different restaurants. Some restaurants charge as much as 30 percent of total cost while others charge less than 10percent. We look at some resturants with high and low delivery charges and also included packing charges for comparision below. The variability in delivery charge seems to be correlated with the total cost of the order. Delivery charges are more prevalent in orders with lower total cost, the percentage delivery charge compared to cost becomes higher for these orders. We do not have data on distance travelled from delivery location to the delivered location which can be a useful metric here to check if these charges are due to resturants being far away. </p>
