                                    <p>In the era of e-commerce, understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses to optimize their strategies and improve customer satisfaction. In this blog post, we will explore insights derived from the "Online Retail Transaction" dataset. This dataset includes information on transactions made by customers through an online retail platform, capturing details such as products purchased, quantities, transaction dates, prices, customer IDs, and customer locations. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that can inform business decisions.</p>
